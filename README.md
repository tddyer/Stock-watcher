# Stock-watcher

## Description

A stock tracking application that was built as a part of my Mobile Application Development course at the Illinois Institute of Technology (CS 442 instructed by Christopher Hield).

## Key Features

- Users can select any stock found on the IEX trading site (https://iextrading.com/apps/stocks/) to be tracked
- The app tracks the latest stock price, price change, and change percentage
- Saved stocks are stored locally in the devices SQLite database and their most recent stock data is fetched upon app startup
- Selecting a stock brings the user to the stock's MarketWatch stock page (eg: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl)
- Stocks are ordered alphabetically and any saved stocks can be deleted by long pressing the desired stock to delete
